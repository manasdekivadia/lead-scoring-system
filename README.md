#  Lead Scoring System

A full-stack AI-powered web application that helps businesses evaluate and prioritize leads. Built with **FastAPI** (Python) for the backend and **React** for the frontend. The system uses a pre-trained ML model (`model.pkl`) to assign scores to leads based on custom logic.

##  Features

-  **FastAPI Backend** — blazing fast, async Python API
-  **React Frontend** — clean, responsive UI
-  **ML-Driven Scoring** — score leads via a trained `model.pkl`
-  **RESTful Architecture** — seamless data flow between front and back
-  **Deploy-Ready** — `render.yaml` config for cloud deployment (Render.com or similar)

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manasdekivadia/lead-scoring-system.git
cd lead-scoring-system
```

---

### 2. Backend Setup (FastAPI)

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

 FastAPI will run at: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

#### Optional:
To explore the API docs:
- Swagger UI: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`

---

### 3. Frontend Setup (React)

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start
```

React app runs at: `http://localhost:3000`

---

##  Deployment

You can deploy this project using [Render](https://render.com) or any platform that supports FastAPI + React apps.

- The `backend/render.yaml` file is preconfigured for deployment.
- You can host the frontend separately (e.g., Netlify, Vercel) or configure full-stack hosting.

## Sample ML Model

The `model.pkl` file is a serialized machine learning model that scores leads based on your predefined logic. Make sure the input format to the model matches what it was trained on.
